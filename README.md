# 2024 Advent of Code

Advent of Code 2024 repository all in Rust as a fun way to help me learn Rust.

In all of these solutions I'm trying to build a reasonably efficient solution both in terms of time and space complexity and also actual run time and memory usage.  But I'm 
focusing on learning Rust, not being overly clever to reduce complexity, so there are a
few cases where I just left the inefficient but easy solution.
